## Compare performance of Merge Sort and Quick Sort for a very large data set.
Reasons to prefer Quick Sort over Merge Sort
| Sorting Technique | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Merge Sort | Ω(n log(n)) | θ(n log(n))	 | O(n log(n)) |
| Quick Sort | Ω(n log(n)) | θ(n log(n))	 | O(n^2) |

1. Merge Sort takes extra memory where as quick-sort works in place
